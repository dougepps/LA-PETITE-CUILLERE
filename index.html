    <p>
        Greetings fellow nerds and nerd-adjacent folks.

If, like me, you've recently learned of "the spoon trick" you must be full of questions.</p>
   <p> What is the spoon trick you ask ? </p>
   <p> It's the idea that you put a spoon (from the Spoon region of France) in the neck of your champagne bottle and that saves the bubbles in case you don't drink the whole bottle in one sitting.</p>

<p>If, also like me, you're reasonably lazy, then you aren't going to do your own experiment.</p>

   
    <div class="clearfix"></div> <!-- Used to clear the float for subsequent content -->
    <p>
        But you are going to go find a paper (in French!). <a href="Valade_et_al.pdf">Le Mythe de la Petite Cuillere</a> from the good people at the Comité Interprofessionnel du vin de Champagne (Interprofessional Committee of Champagne Wine).
        Who were nice enough to do the experiments for us in 1994.
    </p>
    <p>
        Then you're going to extract the text and make it a google doc and then auto-translate that to english, <a href="translatedMyth.pdf"> The Myth of the Little Spoon</a>

    </p>

    <p>
        The upshot is "The pressure drop is of the same order of magnitude whether with or without a teaspoon.the loss is greater than 50% after 48 hours, in both cases"
    </p>

    <p>
        Fun fact, the bubble formation "occurs from a potassium bitartrate crystal, a residue of yeast or stirring
aid, or an imperfection on the glass surface.".  The bubbles come out of solution and need there to be a "heterogeneous induced nucleation".
    </p>

    <h2>
        Basically: A small spoon, even a silver one, placed in the neck of a bottle will never stop champagne from
degassing. </h2>
<p>From what I can gather the most important thing is to <b>keep it cold</b>. That way the gas never comes out of solution.</p>
